              Our love story began on a rainy Tuesday morning in a small coffee shop 
              downtown. Sarah was reading her favorite book, and Michael couldn't help 
              but notice her smile when she reached the funny parts. After gathering 
              the courage to approach her, what started as a conversation about books 
              turned into hours of talking about everything and nothing.

            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              After five wonderful years together, Michael knew Sarah was the one. 
              He planned the perfect proposal during their annual trip to the mountains, 
              at the same hiking trail where they had their first adventure together. 
              As the sun set behind the peaks, he got down on one knee and asked the 
              most important question of his life.
